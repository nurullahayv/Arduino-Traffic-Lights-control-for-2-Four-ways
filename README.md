# Arduino-Traffic-Lights-control-for-2-Four-ways
Arduino Traffic Lights control project for 2 Four-ways

(...)

In this project its aimed to make an Arduino based traffic signalization of two
four-ways.

In this system its planned to design most effective(as waiting times) system. So
system has always green crosswalks with green to cars. And also two intersections are
synchronised.
The LEDs are connected to Arduino UNO and programmed on it. There were
eight situations for roads and its coded on.


The LEDs are grouped before connections for using less pins on Arduino UNO
because there are not much pins. And also this is more efficient. And each groups blinking time can be controlled on
Arduino with changing the code.
